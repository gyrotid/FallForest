# FallForest

Recursion allows each branch to call it's individual branches to move alongside it. A small change has a ripple effect across the entire branch. This models how factors like wind can affect the entire forest ecosystem.

In nature you can see recursive patterns in almost everything, life ripples and effects everything. I think some of the most famous applications of the idea is in something like the butterfly theory where one tiny change can effect all of life as we know it.

This code mirror a natural process in how each call to fallLeaves() acts like a cycle of the year, the loss and growth of leaves.

I learned that recursion can really be made from repettion, almost like a loop. But it's automated in a way, it's cool!
